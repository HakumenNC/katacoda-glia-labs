You can Import/export your data as streams of events with Kafka Connect

You probably have lots of data in existing systems like relational databases or
 traditional messaging systems, along with many applications that already use these
  systems.
  
[Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) allows you to
 continuously ingest data from external systems into Kafka, and vice versa.
 It is thus very easy to integrate existing systems with Kafka.
 
 To make this process even easier, there are hundreds of such connectors readily available.

Take a look at the [Kafka Connect section](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect)
